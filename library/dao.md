About JuiceboxDAO: The Juicebox protocol is developed by JuiceboxDAO. JuiceboxDAO has no CEO, no hiring department, and no Board of Directors; instead, it is self-governed via the JBX token. "DAO" stands for *Decentralized Autonomous Organization* — by utilizing token governance and the Juicebox protocol itself, JuiceboxDAO is able to manage strategic decisions, payouts to contributors, and to consistently deliver upgrades to the Juicebox protocol, along with a suite of tools to support it.

How it works: JuiceboxDAO's project has project ID #1 on each version of the Juicebox protocol. You can find our current v2 project [here](https://juicebox.money/@juicebox), and our old v1 project [here](https://juicebox.money/p/juicebox). The DAO is funded through a combination of direct contributions and [protocol fees](#about-fees). When people pay JuiceboxDAO, either directly or through fees, JBX tokens are minted. JBX tokens work in the exact same way as other Juicebox project tokens: by default, they are internally managed by the protocol (in order to save on gas fees), but they can be claimed as an [ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) token if desired. JBX can be issued at any time, according to the rules of JuiceboxDAO's projects. It can also be redeemed at any time to reclaim some of the ETH from the DAO's projects (also according to their rules). These rules are decided upon by JBX token voting on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/jbdao.eth/). Approved proposals are then implemented by the DAO's 9/14 [Gnosis Safe Multisig](https://app.safe.global/eth:0xAF28bcB48C40dBC86f52D459A6562F658fc94B1e/), which has signers who are elected through DAO governance. You can see the our full Governance Process [here](https://docs.juicebox.money/dao/process/) — this process is also decided upon and ratified by JBX voters.
