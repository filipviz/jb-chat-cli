JuiceboxDAO has an open contribution policy. Anyone can pitch in and help with any of the DAO's efforts. Unlike traditional workplaces, the DAO is open to pseudonymous contributors ("anons"). New contributors are not expected to present a resum√© or any other identifying material. New contributors should see our [contribution guide](https://docs.juicebox.money/dao/contribute/) and introduce themselves in the [JuiceboxDAO Discord server](https://discord.gg/juicebox/).
