Most projects ratify some type of Governance Process to use alongside Snapshot voting. Feel free to use [our process](https://docs.juicebox.money/dao/process/) as a starting point.

From the [Snapshot Docs](https://docs.snapshot.org/):
> Snapshot is a decentralized voting system. It provides flexibility on how voting power is calculated for a vote. Snapshot supports various voting types to cater to the needs of organizations. Creating proposals and voting on Snapshot is user-friendly and does not cost gas as the process is performed off-chain.
> In short, Snapshot is an off-chain gasless multi-governance client with easy to verify and hard to contest results.

You can deploy a Snapshot space for your project on [snapshot.org](https://snapshot.org/#/setup), or you can:

1. Visit your project's page on [juicebox.money](https://juicebox.money).
2. Open your project settings by clicking the gear in the upper right-hand corner.
3. Selecting `Governance` in the left-hand sidebar.

Both of these options will require you to have an ENS address (this is a short name ending with `.eth` that refers to your wallet). If you don't have an ENS, visit [app.ens.domains](https://app.ens.domains). Once your space is created, visit it on [Snapshot.org](https://snapshot.org/#/) and open the `Settings`. Here, you can change your space's name & avatar, and configure how voting power is calculated with one or more **Strategies**.

Snapshot strategies for Juicebox projects are available on the [Juicebox Docs](https://docs.juicebox.money/user/resources/snapshot). If you need help customizing your parameters or are looking for a different strategy, send a message in the [Juicebox Discord](https://discord.gg/juicebox).
