About fees: Juicebox projects pay a 2.5% fee when they pay a wallet outside of the Juicebox ecosystem. To be clear:

- There are no fees when projects receive payments.
- There are no fees on redemptions.
- There are no fees on payouts from a Juicebox project to another Juicebox project.
- When a project has a payout to an external wallet address, a 2.5% fee is automatically paid to JuiceboxDAO's project.

In exchange for paying this fee, projects receive JBX at the current issuance rate, thereby partially governing the protocol. The fee can be set anywhere between 0% and 5%, as decided by JuiceboxDAO governance. The protocol has very minimal global governance, which you can learn about [here](https://docs.juicebox.money/dev/learn/administration/). Projects can also temporarily set fees aside with [Hold fees](https://docs.juicebox.money/dev/learn/glossary/hold-fees/). This can be useful if a project needs to temporarily pull funds out of their project, but plans to return those funds to the project later on and does not want to pay fees in the interim.
