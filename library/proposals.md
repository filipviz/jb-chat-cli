How to create a JuiceboxDAO governance proposal:

1. Visit the [JuiceboxDAO governance portal](https://jbdao.org)
2. Click `New Proposal` in the upper right-hand corner.
3. Click `Connect` in the upper right-hand corner. If you don't have a wallet, you can get one from [MetaMask.io](https://metamask.io).
4. Select your proposal's type, fill out all of the metadata fields, and write your proposal in the editor below.
5. Click `Submit`.
6. A discussion thread for your proposal will be generated in the `#ðŸ’¡-proposals` channel of [Juicebox's Discord server](https://discord.gg/juicebox). The community will help you prepare the proposal for the next temperature check.

The revision process can cause a proposal to take more than one funding cycle to reach the Juicebox snapshot. Honest and plain feedback in Discord proposal threads is encouraged.
