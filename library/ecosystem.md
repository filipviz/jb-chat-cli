Some projects within the Juicebox ecosystem:

Peel is the group of developers behind [juicebox.money](https://juicebox.money), the flagship interface for the Juicebox protocol. If you're looking to commission a custom website for your project, inquire in [Peel's Discord](https://discord.gg/7NmqDwGhn2).

[Blunt](https://blunt.fund/) allows anyone to deploy a trustless crowdfunding round where contributors can get refunds at any point before the round is closed successfully – if a pre-defined target isn't met, refunds are made available to everyone. Blunt works best for project creators that know how much they need to raise ahead of time and want to maximize supporter trust.

[Defifa](https://www.defifa.net/) allows anyone to create an onchain prediction game for sports, elections, world events, or anything else. A game's creator sets up teams (representing the sports teams, political candidates, or world event outcomes) which anyone can join by buying a team's NFTs. Buying NFTs loads a shared reward pot, and the winning teams get more of that pot when the game ends. Which teams "win" is determined by onchain voting. Once NFT buying closes, anyone can score the contest to determine how much of the pot goes to each team. At least 50% of teams need to approve a set of scores by majority vote – otherwise, everyone can reclaim their ETH from the pot.

[Croptop](https://croptop.eth.limo) allows anyone to host a peer-to-peer content feed on IPNS and make it available from their ENS address (for example, see [`jango.eth.limo`](https://jango.eth.limo)). Each image, video, audio clip, or text post can be minted as an NFT from the owner's Juicebox project.

[Nance](https://nance.app) is a governance platform for Juicebox projects which integrates with Discord, Snapshot, Safe, Notion, and Juicebox. [JuiceboxDAO's Governance](https://docs.juicebox.money/dao/process/) runs through Nance – if you need help setting up or facilitating governance for your project, inquire in the [Nance Discord](https://discord.gg/SUyeNcEuaK).

Bananapus [was created](https://www.jbdao.org/p/368) to work on L2 deployments, on-chain governance, and cross-chain staking for Juicebox projects. 

WAGMI Studios is the team behind the art on [juicebox.money](https://juicebox.money) and JuiceboxDAO's online profiles – if you need art for NFTs or branding, inquire in their [Discord](https://discord.com/XnYFFGaXsu).
